# `happy.hbrem` R package

This repository holds the source code for the HAPPY package developed by
Richard Mott, which is described at http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mus/www/magic/.

Since the link from that website seems to be unavailable, I decided to upload the
code to this repository, since the
[`MagicHelpR`](https://github.com/tavareshugo/MagicHelpR) package depends on it.

I have not changed the source code, and provide it as I last downloaded it,
preserving its license and authorship.

## Installation

```r
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tavareshugo/happy.hbrem")
```
